        My name is Terry and I am a self-taught web developer with a traditional art background. I originally went to school to study animation and illustration which transitioned into a career creating 3D animations for games and videos. Eventually I found myself stuck in a creative rut and stepped away to find a way to reinvent myself.

        I decided to take some programming classes at a community college and found out that I had a real knack for it. I realized that so many of the concepts I had learned in art also applied to programming. The importance of a strong design rather than its implementation was a principle that I had been so familiar with in my previous career. It has revitalized my passion for design and my goal is to find new ways to apply my old skills.
