        My name is Terry and I am an aspiring web developer with a background in traditional art. I originally went to school to study animation and illustration which transitioned into a career working as an animator and video producer on various projects. Throughout the years, I discovered that I really enjoyed the technical aspects of the job. I liked learning new technologies and techniques to solve the unique problems that each project presented.

        After dabbling with some programming classes at a community college and thoroughly enjoying the work, I decided to pursue a career change by attending a coding bootcamp. At Rithm School, I learned full stack development and was able to collaborate with other developers on a wide range of projects. Coding has revitalized my passion for learning and I am always looking for the opportunity to work with others and improve myself.
